# Component Library

A reusable web component library written in TypeScript.

## Usage

1. Build the library:
   ```sh
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
2. Import and use the components in your project.

## Example: Hello World Component

```
<hello-world></hello-world>
```

## Development
- Each component is split into `.ts`, `.html`, and `.css` files for logic, template, and styles.
- Components are defined as native custom elements.
